  abstract = {What is that intangible force that makes some classrooms positively buzz with interest, attention, and excitement about learning? While motivation can't easily be quantified, few would dispute its essential role in promoting academic engagement and achievement. This uniquely practical book is the first how-to guide on motivating students in grades K-3. Presented are research-based strategies and techniques that are brought to life in three extended case studies of highly successful motivators. Vividly demonstrating how these exemplary teachers flood their classrooms with motivation, the book provides inspiration and practical ideas that readers can implement in their own work. It also guides teachers in recognizing and avoiding key pitfalls--the attitudes, instructional methods, and classroom management approaches that may inadvertantly undermine student motivation. Key Features: The first how-to book on this important topic Senior author Michael Pressley is a popular, visible figure with a stellar reputation. Practical, realistic classroom suggestions are illustrated by case material. Appendix provides checklists of what works (and what doesn't) in promoting academic motivation.},

  abstract = {A century can be understood in many ways - in terms of its inventions, its crimes or its art. In Opening Skinner's Box, Lauren Slater sets out to investigate the twentieth century through a series of ten fascinating, witty and sometimes shocking accounts of its key psychological experiments. Starting with the founder of modern scientific experimentation, {B.F.} Skinner, Slater traces the evolution of the last hundred years' most pressing concerns - free will, authoritarianism, violence, conformity and morality. Previously buried in academic textbooks, these often daring experiments are now seen in their full context and told as stories, rich in plot, wit and character.},

  abstract = {The finding that extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation has been highly controversial since it first appeared (Deci, 1971). A meta-analysis published in this journal (Cameron \& Pierce, 1994) concluded that the undermining effect was minimal and largely inconsequential for educational policy. However, a more recent meta-analysis (Deci, Koestner, \& Ryan, 1999) showed that the Cameron and Pierce meta-analysis was seriously flawed and that its conclusions were incorrect. This article briefly reviews the results of the more recent meta-analysis, which showed that tangible rewards do indeed have a substantial undermining effect. The meta-analysis provided strong support for cognitive evaluation theory (Deci \& Ryan, 1980), which Cameron and Pierce had advocated abandoning. The results are briefly discussed in terms of their relevance for educational practice.},
